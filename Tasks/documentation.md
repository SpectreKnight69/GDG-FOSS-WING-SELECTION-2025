# Brave Browser

**1. Introduction**

Brave is free and open-source web source browser launched in 2016. It was created by Brendan Eich who is co-founder of Mozilla and creator of JavaScript. It is built on Chromium hence feels very similar to using Chrome

**2. Prerequisites**

If you have used Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge then you can easily use Brave. No special technical skills are required to use Brave.

**3. Installation and Setup**

Brave can be downloaded directly from brave.com. It works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS. After installation, you can import bookmarks/history from your old browser and start browsing seamlessly.

**4. Why this Exists**

Brave is designed to give users faster and safer browsing experience. Unlike other browsers, it blocks ads, trackers and third party cookies that collect personal data. Brave also gives user a fairer ad model which rewards the user with BAT(Basic Attention tokens) upon choosing to see ads.

**5.  How to Use**

Using Brave is similar to using any other web browser. You can search, browse and manage tabs as usual. In addition to this, users can enable Brave Rewards to earn tokens by allowing the browser to display ads and also use Tor mode for anonymous browsing.

**6. Real World Use Cases**

Brave is useful for people who want distraction free and private browsing experience. Students can use it for research without the continuously annoying ad interruptions. Also for the people interested in Web3, Brave has a built-in crypto wallet and it supports decentralized web technologies.

**7. Why itâ€™s Better than Alternatives**

Compared to Chrome, Brave offers strong privacy as it blocks trackers and third-party cookies.
While Firefox is also privacy focused, but Brave is faster due to ad-blocking feature.
And unlike Microsoft Edge, which collects the user data, Brave is fully open-sourced and transparent. It also has Unique Reward model (BAT) which is not available in any other browsers.

**8. My Opinions**

 I chose to write about Brave as it is simple yet loaded with features that are unique and impactful that no other browser offers. It also inspires me to contribute in the FOSS community and shows how the FOSS community can build a top-notch product when given the opportunity.
