**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: 
I want to join the GDG FOSS Wing as it would provide me the opportunity to collaborate with like minded people in our college and other colleges as well. When I found that the everyday tools that I use like Brave and VLC media player are made by the FOSS community and not companies, I became curious and inspired to become a contributor. I also aim to contribute to the upcoming GSoC, and I believe being part of the FOSS Wing will help me refine my skills and contribute effectively. Along with that, I think the FOSS culture in our college should grow more hence Iâ€™d like to put my knowledge and communication skills to good use by guiding and teaching juniors about FOSS.
